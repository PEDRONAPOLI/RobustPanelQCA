Description: Implements panel fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis 
    (fsQCA) with comprehensive robustness testing. Provides pooled (POCONS), 
    between-period (BECONS), and within-case (WICONS) consistency metrics 
    for evaluating configurational stability across time and units. Includes 
    random deletion robustness testing for both necessity and sufficiency.
