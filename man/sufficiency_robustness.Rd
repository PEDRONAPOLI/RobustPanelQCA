\title{Robustness Test for Sufficiency (Random Deletion)}
\usage{
sufficiency_robustness(data, outcome, conditions, params = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame with calibrated fuzzy-set variables.}

\item{outcome}{Character. Name of the outcome variable.}

\item{conditions}{Character vector. Names of condition variables.}

\item{params}{A pfsqca_params object. If NULL, uses default parameters.}
}
\value{
A list with:
\describe{
\item{baseline_terms}{Terms from the original analysis}
\item{freq_tbl}{Data frame with term frequencies across iterations}
}
}
\description{
Tests robustness of sufficient configurations by randomly deleting
observations and re-running the analysis multiple times.
}
\details{
For each iteration, a proportion of cases (defined by params$robustness_drop)
is randomly removed, and sufficiency analysis is re-run. The frequency
table shows how often each term appears across all iterations.

Terms appearing in >= params$robust_PI_freq_cut of iterations are
considered robust.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
params <- pfsqca_params(robustness_B = 100)  # fewer iterations for testing
rob <- sufficiency_robustness(data_cal, "outcome", conditions, params)
rob$freq_tbl  # see which terms are robust
}
