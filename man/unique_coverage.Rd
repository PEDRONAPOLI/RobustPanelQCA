\title{Calculate Unique Coverage for Terms}
\usage{
unique_coverage(data, outcome, terms)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame with calibrated fuzzy-set variables.}

\item{outcome}{Character. Name of the outcome variable.}

\item{terms}{Character vector. Solution terms to analyze.}
}
\value{
A data frame with columns:
\describe{
\item{term}{The configuration term}
\item{raw_cov}{Raw coverage of the term}
\item{unique_cov}{Unique coverage (not shared with other terms)}
\item{cons}{Consistency of the term}
}
}
\description{
Calculates raw coverage, unique coverage, and consistency for each
term in a solution.
}
\details{
Raw coverage measures how much of the outcome is covered by each term.
Unique coverage measures how much is covered ONLY by that term and
not by any other term in the solution.

\examples{
\dontrun{
suf <- sufficiency_analysis(data_cal, "outcome", conditions, params)
cov <- unique_coverage(data_cal, "outcome", suf$terms)
cov  # see coverage breakdown
}
