\title{Membership in a Term (Conjunction)}
\usage{
term_membership(data, term)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame with calibrated fuzzy-set variables.}

\item{term}{Character. The term expressed as literals joined by "\emph{"
(e.g., "income}patents*~density").}
}
\value{
Numeric vector of membership scores (minimum across all literals).
}
\description{
Calculates membership scores for a term, which is a conjunction (AND)
of multiple literals.
}
\details{
In fuzzy-set logic, conjunction (AND) is calculated as the minimum
of membership scores across all literals in the term.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
data_cal <- calibrate_panel(data, c("income", "patents", "density"))
term_membership(data_cal, "income*patents")
term_membership(data_cal, "income*~density")
}
