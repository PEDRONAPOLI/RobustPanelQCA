\title{Consistency and Coverage for Sufficiency}
\usage{
cons_cov_suf(X, Y)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{Numeric vector. Membership scores for the condition/configuration.}

\item{Y}{Numeric vector. Membership scores for the outcome.}
}
\value{
A named numeric vector with elements \code{consistency} and \code{coverage}.
}
\description{
Calculates consistency and coverage for a sufficiency relation (X → Y).
}
\details{
For sufficiency (X is subset of Y):
\itemize{
\item Consistency = sum(min(X,Y)) / sum(X)
\item Coverage = sum(min(X,Y)) / sum(Y)
}
}
\examples{
X <- c(0.2, 0.5, 0.8, 0.9)
Y <- c(0.3, 0.6, 0.7, 0.95)
cons_cov_suf(X, Y)
