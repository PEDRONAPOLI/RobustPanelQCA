\title{Membership in a Solution (Disjunction)}
\usage{
solution_membership(data, terms)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame with calibrated fuzzy-set variables.}

\item{terms}{Character vector. Each element is a term (conjunction of literals).}
}
\value{
Numeric vector of membership scores (maximum across all terms).
}
\description{
Calculates membership scores for a solution, which is a disjunction (OR)
of multiple terms.
}
\details{
In fuzzy-set logic, disjunction (OR) is calculated as the maximum
of membership scores across all terms in the solution.

A solution like "A\emph{B + C}~D" would be passed as:
\code{terms = c("A*B", "C*~D")}
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
data_cal <- calibrate_panel(data, c("A", "B", "C", "D"))
solution_membership(data_cal, c("A*B", "C*~D"))
}

}
